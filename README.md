# ipweek2_r unsupervised learning with R. 
## k means clustering and Hierachical clustering

The Plastinina brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.
We performed clustering so as to group our data.

## technologies

We used K means because it is an easy to implement technique and is computationally inexpensive.
We also used Hierachical since it's easy to implement and also to differentiate between the two techniques. 

## challenges
Hierachical is somewhat computationally expensive.
R studio desktop kept on crushing.
Installing some packages proved cumbersome and their dependencies.i.e tidyverse, factorextra, soilDB

# How to Install and Run the Project

A. Installing R language and its dependencies.
B. Installing R Studio Desktop and its dependencies.
